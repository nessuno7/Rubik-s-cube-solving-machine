# Rubik-s-cube-solving-machine
The machine solves the Rubik's cube by using the CFOP method, which method allows to solve any scrambled Rubik's cube with 60~100 moves. More information regarding the code in F2L_algorithm/readme_F2L.md\
The machine's structure is made of a Lego structure to hold the motors into place and 3D printed parts to attach the motors to the centre of the Rubik's cube. More information regarding the structure in CAD_design/CAD_readme.md\
The electronics of the machine consist of 6 stepper motors controlled with an Arduino Mega. More information regarding the electronics in Electronics/electronics_readme.md\
The code used for Arduino Mega is found in the Arduino_code folder. More information regarding the code in Arduino_code/arduino_readme.md\
