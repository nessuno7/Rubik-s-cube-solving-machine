# CAD design
The machine involves a Lego structure, built using Lego pieces from old Lego technic sets, that holds the 6 stepper motors together and 3D printed parts used to connect the stepper motors to the centre of the Cube.\
\
All 3D printed components were desgined using Fusion 360 and printed using PLA.\
The attachment for the cube was initially designed for the Original Rubik’s speed cube, however, after the cube was changed to another model, the attachment were attached to the new Rubik’s cube using superglue.\
The attachment for the motors was printed much longer than the actual lenght needed, and was then cut down to fit perfectly inside the structure to avoid printing the same part multiple times.
